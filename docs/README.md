## How to Play

Install `supercharge.jar` in your `.minecraft/mods/` folder. That's it!

### Requirements

- Make sure [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install) is already installed on your Minecraft client. I recommend using the Vanilla launcher.
- Once the Fabric launcher is installed, get the [Fabric API](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fabric), which powers Fabric mods, and place it in your `mods/` folder (appears after running Fabric from the Minecraft launcher for the first time).
- To see enabled mods, install [Mod Menu](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modmenu), which adds a button on the start screen and pause menu.

## How to Build

- `cd plugin && ./gradlew build`
