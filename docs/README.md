Requirements
</h2>

1. Make sure [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install) is already installed on your Minecraft client. I recommend using the Vanilla launcher.
2. Once the Fabric launcher is installed, get the [Fabric API](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fabric), which powers Fabric mods, and place it in your `mods/` folder (appears after running Fabric from the Minecraft launcher for the first time).
3. To see enabled mods, install [Mod Menu](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modmenu), which adds a button on the start screen and pause menu.

How to Build
</h2>

```
cd plugin && ./gradlew build
```

Depending on your machine, you may have to run `gradle` or the `gradlew.bat` file locally to setup the gradle wrapper.
